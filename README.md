# <h1>Chat Room</h1>
<h2>Developed over the course of a few weeks this chat room was a
mini project of mine outside of college</h2>

<h3>The project in its current form contains the following "features":</h3>
(what would be considered obvious inclusions but I didnt know what I was doing so they're features)<br>

  - <b>Hashed passwords</b>
  
  - Shared chat accessable for <b>all users all over the world</b>
  
  - <b>Secure sign in</b> and out system using sessions to monitor the users progress through the site
      - No longer carries the users username around with them but uses a session instead 
    
  - Using <b>css and @medias</b> to make the site usable on all manner of devices (phones, tables, laptops, blimps)
  
<h3>To-do list:</h3>

  - Assign users <b>different colours</b> for their chats
  
  - Make the sign in process more <b>streamlined</b>
  
  - Add a <b>password reset</b> function
  
  - If even possible, incorperate an <b>SQL database</b>
